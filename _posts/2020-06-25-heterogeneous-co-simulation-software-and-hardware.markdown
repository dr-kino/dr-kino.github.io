The idea to write this post appeared some years ago when I was working as a FPGA Developer, my goal is make this tutorial simple and guided by practical exercise to clarify the co-simulation usage. When I had the opportunity to work with this test methodology I really stayed excited, imagine test software and hardware (worlds completelly differents) interacting via command line, it was so cool.

Now I will go straigth on the subject trying to answer the question: Why is co-simulation and for where i can apply this knowledgement?
