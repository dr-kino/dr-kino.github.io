First of all, I would like to register that this post has nointention to teach how to break the laws. It is just a theme that should be developed for study and research purposes, I will write the next article as soon as relevant findings emerge. As I have no much time to be dedicated in this research, maybe it will take long time until next publication, because of this the current article will talsk a little bit about some tools devoted to Software Defined Radio.
