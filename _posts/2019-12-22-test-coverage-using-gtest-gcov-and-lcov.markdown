This post will describe a setup to start working with test coverage. First of all, I would like to post the GitHub link of this project [BraveCoverage](https://github.com/dr-kino/BraveCoverage)

It is related to a very small piece of code to demonstrate how to start a project providing test coverage metrics. But for what it is important? In resume, when you provide unit test for your code it means that you are a person concerned about the quality of your delivered work.
