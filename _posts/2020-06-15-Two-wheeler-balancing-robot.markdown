The 2-Wheeler Balancing Mechanical Kit is used to apply control laws related to inverted pendulum, with this mechanical kit I will start a serie related to control this kit. For this task I will use the Hercules LaunchPad, based on TMS-570 microcontrollers from Texas Instruments. 

In the next image is possible to see that this robot is composed by two motors that will be controlled by the microcontroller and the main sensor, the 6DOF MPU-6050 3 Axis Gyro.
