From the datasheet, the LM741 can be operated in an open-loop configuration.The magnitude of the open-loop gain is typically large thus for a small difference between the non inverting and inverting input terminals, the amplifier output will be driven near the supply voltage. Without negative feedback,the LM741 can act as a comparator. If the inverting input is held at 0 V, and the input voltage applied to the non inverting input is positive,the output will be positive. If the input voltage applied to the non inverting input is negative, the output will be negative.
